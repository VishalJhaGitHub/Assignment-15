    "#1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Ans\n",
    "\n",
    "#A database is a collection of data that is organized and stored in a computer system. The data in a database can be structured in tables, which consist of rows and columns, or it can be unstructured.\n",
    "\n",
    "#SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two types of databases that differ in their data models, query languages, and usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#SQL databases are relational databases that use a tabular structure to store data. They are characterized by their fixed schema, which means that the structure of the database is defined at the time of creation and cannot be changed without altering the schema. SQL databases are widely used in applications that require complex queries and transactions, such as banking and finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#NoSQL databases, on the other hand, use a non-relational data model, which allows for flexible schema designs that can adapt to changing data needs. NoSQL databases can store both structured and unstructured data and can be used for a variety of applications, including web and mobile applications, social networks, and real-time analytics."

It is used to enforce the integrity of the data in the table and to ensure that each row can be uniquely identified. For example, in a table of \"employees\", the \"employee_id\" column may be chosen as the primary key because it is unique for each employee and can be used to identify them uniquely.\n",

It establishes a relationship between the two tables, allowing data from one table to be linked to data in another table. For example, in a table of \"orders\", there may be a column named \"customer_id\" that references the primary key of the \"customers\" table.
